After the first impression -- given by the mood of the site -- people browsing a webshop are immediately looking for <em>trust</em>.

Trust can be built in many ways, important is to persist the confidence on all pages and whenever is necessary.

In the <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/reports/internet-statistics-compendium">2010 Internet Statistics Compendium</a>, by Econsultancy.com, on e-commerce and online marketing, there is an interesting section dealing with why people are abandoning websites and dropping shopping carts.
<ol>
	<li>79% is looking for <strong>direct contact</strong>: live chat, phone number, etc.</li>
	<li>74% of drops are caused by people thinking <strong>buying offline is faster than online</strong>.</li>
	<li>68% thinks offline <strong>support</strong> is better than online.</li>
	<li>46% are looking for <strong>recommendations</strong> from other customers</li>
	<li> 46% are thinking <strong>shipping</strong> price might raise the final price.</li>
	<li>37% would like to <strong>compare prices</strong> before buying.</li>
	<li>27% are looking for <strong>sales</strong> and <strong>coupons</strong>.</li>
</ol>
It's up to the webshop theme developer to direct the visitor attention <em>immediately</em> to those informational spaces which are dissolving all the concerns above.
<h2>Contact and Support</h2>
In our opinion and experience answering the 1. and 3. concerns  -- both similar -- are the first and most important tasks. And once the trust is established the site must persist the confidence on all of it's pages.

This forces the designer to put the Contact and Support section in the header of the website, in the neighborhood of other stable elements like the navigation menu and the shopping cart itself.

This way the content of the Main Menu, the menu items -- placed usually on the upper right corner of the page -- becomes very important for every webshop.
<h2>How to Buy?</h2>
Once the visitor likes your site and products, put trust in getting to you easily and anytime, the next step is to think about how she will buy:
<ol>
	<li>Will the shopping process be complicated (user registration, filling out forms, reading terms and conditions, etc.) or straightforward (just the bare minimum to work with).</li>
	<li>Will the product be shipped smoothly and with minimal costs?</li>
	<li>What if the product is not the wanted, or, if it can be returned?</li>
	<li>Do any additional services / surprises are offered?</li>
</ol>
These answers must be shown at the front page, and mandatory, in a more detailed way at the product page, later on the checkout page.

The designer has more freedom creating these informational spaces, some playing and spice can be added to drive the customer.
<h2>Good Products?</h2>
