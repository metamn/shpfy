Once you have purchased your Shopify theme from Shopledge you should customize according to your needs.

Customizing should take from a couple of minutes to maximum one hour.
<h1><!--more-->Add Your Logo</h1>
After installing the theme purchased your shop header section might look like this:

[caption id="attachment_293" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Your Theme Header"]<a class="lightbox" href="http://www.shopledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/header.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-293 " title="Your Theme Header" src="http://www.shopledge.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/header-500x33.png" alt="Your Theme Header" width="500" height="33" /></a>[/caption]

Either you are keeping your site without logo, as is, or you upload a small logo and replace your shop name.

We recommend to use a small, standard-sized logo of <strong>120x60 pixels</strong>. You can check out the <a href="http://www.shopledge.com/2011/02/02/the-gadgetoman-theme-cheatsheet">theme cheatsheet</a> for more information.

Navigate to your <em>Admin Area </em>→<em> Theme </em>→<em> Theme Settings</em> and make your modifications.

<h1>Adjust Header Background and Colors</h1>
Perhaps the original theme design will be altered by your logo, your brand identity. No problem you can adjust every color of your theme.

It is important to keep the color harmony -- if you have no designer to consult you, use<a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/"> Adobe's color generator</a> to choose analogous, complementary, compound or similar colors.

<h1>Manage Your Main Menu</h1>
In the header section, at left hand side, you'll find your default main Main Menu created by Shopify.

These default items -- Home, Catalog, Blog, About Us -- are usually enough, but, we suggest you should consider these <a href="http://www.shopledge.com/2011/02/02/building-trust-on-a-webshop-with-information">best practices</a> and update your menu bar.

We suggest add two or three new menu items: <em>Contact</em>, <em>Support</em>, <em>How to Buy?</em> (or join the first two items into <em>Contact and Support</em>) and collect them into a new link list called <em>Shopping Menu</em>. (this name is mandatory otherwise the theme won't recognize it).

All this is a three step operation as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Create the pages in <em><em>Admin Area </em>→ Blogs &amp; Pages → Create a new page</em>.</li>
	<li>Create a new link list in Admin Area <em>→ Navigation </em><em>→ Add link list.
</em></li>
	<li>Add the pages to the link list created , in <em><em>Admin Area </em>→ Navigation → Shopping Menu</em> and <em>Add link</em>.</li>
</ol>
